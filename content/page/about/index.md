I think that philosophy is the stuff that keeps the world going. It is the grease that makes the engine turn. It is the milk I have with my cereal to dissolve my weetbix in the morning so that I can be full. It is the glue that I use to stick photos into my scrapbook. It is the colours that paint the world that I see. It is the soap I use to clean my hair. It is a lot more things than this, but I'll leave the rest as an exercise for the reader.

One of my favourite stories is *Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone* since it is all about philosophy and not dumb stuff like heroism and magic. Eugh. I don't like made up stuff. In fact one of the quotes I live by is as follows.

> Look up. Sooner or later you will be surprised.

This has always kept me going in the tough, dark times of my life.
One example was when I forgot to get off at the right train station. This was really hard for me as I had to wait for another train to get home. But I never gave up. I *looked up* and thought: "I can do this!!!!". And then I arrived home. The end.


I really hope you like my blog. Give it a read and let me know how I did!

If you have any complaints make sure to follow my three step policy before sending me any hate-mail at [fletcher@flech.pages.dev](fletcher@fletch.pages.dev).

1. Is it kind? If it is not kind then it is mean. I think being mean is bad. Read some of my posts about this and maybe you will want to be kind instead.
2. Would you wear a t-shirt if it was printed on the back? For example I might wear a shirt that said *"Really cool blog post but I disagree with your portrayal of the archetype of man as a macho villain"* but I wouldn't wear a shirt that said *"nice post"*.
3. If you reach this point maybe you should give up. Don't send me any mail. The email I wrote is a FAKE EMAIL. **GET PRANKED**
